$ yarn dev
```

## API Documentation

[Swagger UI](http://localhost:3000/docs/swagger#/)

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development & watch mode
$ yarn dev

# production mode
$ yarn start
```

## Database Management
```bash
# make empty migration file
$ yarn db:make

# run migrations
$ yarn db:up

# reset previous migration
$ yarn db:prev

# make empty seed file
$ yarn seed make

# seeding DB
$ yarn seed run

# reseting all migration and run seed
$ yarn db:init
```

## Test

**WE WILL ONLY TEST .service.ts FILE**

Repository testing is turned off my default since we're using a typesafe orm. In my opinion its a waste of time to test repository. We let typescript handle our sql bug.

**Our test will not connect to DB by default**

**If you really want to test Repo (With DB)**

you can add this config into jest config in package.json to connect db in test. This will setup the db and run the default seed located in *src/core/db/seeds*. when writing use the util function *createRepoTestingModule*.
```json
"globalSetup": "<rootDir>/jest-global.setup.ts",
"globalTeardown": "<rootDir>/jest-global.teardown.ts",
```

I'm using package.json as config **Do not use jest.config.ts** it will cause bug with the repo setup.

**Running the test**

There're  2 types of test avaliable, unit and mutation. We don't care about test coverage score because it doesn't really help locate bug. But **WE DO CARE** about **mutation score** so in **pipeline CI please use mutation test**.

```bash
# unit tests
$ yarn test

# mutation test
$ yarn test:mutation
```

Report will be generate at *test-report/stryker.html* you can look at your issue and score there. threshold for coverage is set to **>70%**

## Writing custom cli

You can write your own cli command. NestjsCommander has already been setup. You can follow the pattern of this folder *src/cli*.

```bash
# running custom cli
$ yarn cli ${name}

# example
$ yarn cli users:seed
```


## Other useful command

```bash
# developing react email
$ yarn dev:email

# running repl
$ yarn repl
```
